This directory contains noisy synthetic images. Each image is stored in PGM
as well as in BMP format.

trin.pgm (resp. trin.bmp) is the original image. Noisy images are produced
by adding 0 mean Gaussian noise. The numbers in the image file names after the 
"trin" prefix denote the noise level in dB. 

For example trin-3.pgm means -3dB of noise added to the original image.
